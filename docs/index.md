## Keep every workflow in view

pmon is a focused desktop monitor for GitHub Actions and Gitlab CI. It polls the last 2 pipelines and shows their status in a tray icon.


::: warning Warning!
This project is in a very early development stage. Most of the code has been vibe-coded and still needs to be reviewed.
The tray icon works (i.e. shows the status of the latest pipeline and the one before that).
The UI is still from the template, however.
I need to clean up the code a lot or even read it.

Use at your own risk.
