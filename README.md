# PMON - GitHub Workflow Monitor

Monitor GitHub workflows and Gitlab pipelines and display their status in a dashboard.

Beware: This project is highly experimental and premature.

At the moment, only one repository is supported.
The frontend still shows a sample page from the initial template.
You can see the status of the latest main pipeline in the tray-icon, nothing more.
Config is loaded from the current working directory and the access token is read from the environment.

Use at your own risk.
